                  RegistryMirrors specifies a mapping of public registries to private mirrors.
                  The key is the public registry (e.g., "ghcr.io", "docker.io", "quay.io")
                  and the value is the private mirror (e.g., "artifactory.example.com/ghcr.io.docker").
                  Example:
                    registryMirrors:

                  SkipProxyForCnspec disables proxy environment variables for cnspec-based components
                  (scan-api, container scanning). Use this when the Mondoo API is accessible directly
                  without proxy (e.g., internal mirror) but other components need proxy for external access.
