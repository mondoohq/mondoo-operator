# Operator Release

This document describes the release process for the operator

## Helm Chart

Mondoo Operator helm chart has been autogenerated using the [helmify](https://github.com/arttor/helmify) tool. The CI uses [chart-releaser-action](https://github.com/helm/chart-releaser-action) to self host the charts using github pages.

The following steps need to be followed to release helm chart.

### Steps

1. Update `Chart.yaml` in the `charts/mondoo-operator` repository with the latest appVersion.
2. Update `Chart.yaml` in the `charts/mondoo-operator` repository with the corresponding version.

### Helm Chart Release Workflow

Helm chart release action is executed on every push to main . It checks each chart in the charts folder, and whenever there's a new chart version, creates a corresponding GitHub release named for the chart version, adds Helm chart artifacts to the release, and creates or updates an index.yaml file with metadata about those releases, which is then hosted on GitHub Pages.

# OLM Bundle for operatorhub.io

The following steps sets are necessary to release the operator to operatorhub.io
