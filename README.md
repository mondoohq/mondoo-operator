## Overview

The **Mondoo Operator** provides a new [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) native way to do a security assessment of your whole Kubernetes Cluster. The purpose of this project is to simplify and automate the configuration for a Mondoo-based security assessment for Kubernetes clusters.

The Mondoo Operator provides the following features:

- Continuous validation of deployed workloads
- Continuous validation of Kubernetes nodes **without** privileged access
- Admission Controller

It is backed by Mondoo's powerful policy-as-code engine [cnspec](https://mondoo.com/docs/cnspec/cnspec-about/) and [MQL](https://mondoo.com/docs/mql/resources/). Mondoo ships out-of-the-box security policies for:

- CIS Kubernetes Benchmarks
- CIS AKS/EKS/GKE/OpenShift Benchmarks
- NSA/CISA Kubernetes Hardening Guide
- Kubernetes Cluster and Workload Security
- Kubernetes Best Practices
